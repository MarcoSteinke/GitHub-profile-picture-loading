# GitHub-profile-picture-loading

Basic demo which shows how to get a profile picture of a GitHub user

You can either click the "submit"-button or hit "ENTER" inside of the input.

The demo can be accessed using the following link: https://www.bestofcode.net/Applications/github-avatar[Click here]

## Usage:

To use this utility in your project there are 2 possibilities:

#### 1. Import inside of the code:

```javascript
import {GitHubProfilePicture} from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarcoSteinke/GitHub-profile-picture-loading@b2a40acad1c52b92bc1ce2887117e9cfc1dba35f/GitHubProfilePicture.js";
```

#### 2. Import into frontend using script-tag:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarcoSteinke/GitHub-profile-picture-loading@b2a40acad1c52b92bc1ce2887117e9cfc1dba35f/GitHubProfilePicture.js"></script>
```

The following code snippet shows an example of how to load an avatar from github:

```javascript

const image = document.querySelector("#myImage")
const avatar = GitHubProfilePicture.loadForUsername("torvalds")
image.src = avatar.getProfilePictureURL()

```

## Future changes:

- In the future this documentation will be more consistently using the term "avatar" instead of sometimes switching to "profile picture"
- The method "getProfilePictureURL()" and the class "GitHubProfilePicture" will be renamed to "getAvatarURL()" and "GitHubAvatar"
